            <p>
                BivittatusDB is a python-based relational database management system (RDBMS) designed for educational purposes. It is built to help users understand the fundamentals of database management, including data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. The project is open-source and aims to provide a simple yet effective way to learn about databases without the complexity of larger systems. It is built to be easily integrated into python code by using python functions and syntax, making it accessible for developers and learners alike. BivittatusDB supports basic SQL-like queries and operations, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their data. The project is still in its early stages, with ongoing development to add more features and improve performance.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="https://github.com/HarbingerOfFire/PMDSA">PMDSA</a></h2>
            <p>
                PMDSA (Photometric Double Star Analysis) is a Python-based software tool designed for the analysis of photometric data from double stars. It provides a user-friendly cli for astronomers and astrophysicists to extract meaningful data from observations. The software supports various data the FITS file format and includes features for statistical analysis, visualization, and reporting. PMDSA aims to facilitate the study of double stars by providing a faster set of tools for data analysis, making it easier for researchers to draw conclusions from their observations.

            <h2>CREATE</h2>
            <p>
                CREATE (Customizable RISC Environment for Adaptable Task Execution) is a project to create a family of open-source processors that are designed to provide integrated-proccessor speeds with dedicated processor performance. The project is still in its early stages with no current publication anywhere, with ongoing development ISA and features of the processors. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please reach out to me via <a href="mailto:harbingeroffire@proton.me">email</a> or on <a href="https://github.com/HarbingerOfFire">Github</a>.
