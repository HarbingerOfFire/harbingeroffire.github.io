            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Malachi Syfrett, also known by my handle <strong>HarbingerOfFire</strong>. 
                I am an aspiring physicist with a hobby in Computer Science. I specialize in low-level/backend development, security analysis, and data analytics, with a passion for building secure, scalable, and data-driven applications.
            </p>

            <h4>Professional Expertise</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Physics (A.S. from SFCC)</li>
                <li>Astronomy</li>
                <li>Low-Level Programming (C, Assembly, Machine Code)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Education</h4>
            <p>
                I hold a Associates's degree in Physical Science from the Santa Fe Community College and am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Physics at New Mexico State University, with a minor in Computer Science. I plan to pursue the accelerated program to achieve a Master's degree in Physics, focusing on Theoretical Physics.
            </p>
            <h4>Technical Skills</h4>
            <p>
                My Computer Science technical stack includes Python, C, Assembly, Machine Code, and SQL for Win32 and Unix systems. I can also work with C++, Rust, and Java if needed. I have experience with various tools such as Git, Docker, and VSCode, and virtual machine environments like QEMU, VMWare and VirtualBox.
            </p>

            <h4>Interests</h4>
            <p>
                My main interests are in Physics, with a goal to become a Theoretical Physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I also have interests in Astronomy, and I have done some work with photometric data analysis. Beyond That, I dive in coding as a hobby. I enjoy diving into low-level architectures and exploring custom CPU designs, as well as contributing to open-source security projects.
            </p>
